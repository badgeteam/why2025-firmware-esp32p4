# WHY 2025 badge firmware for the ESP32-P4
This repository contains the firmware and launcher that runs on the badge's ESP32-P4 application processor.
Like MCH2022's native apps, you can once again write apps in C that run natively on the badge.
This time, however, these native apps are no longer separate firmwares but are instead loaded by the launcher and re-use common code from it.
